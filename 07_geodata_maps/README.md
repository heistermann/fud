# Level 7: Geodata and mapping

## Learning targets

- What functionality do we actually expect when we work with geodata and produce maps?
- Usage of the most important tools for working with geodata in R and Python.

## Structure and main contents

- Start with mapping DWD rain gauges - no dedicated GIS functionality is actually used
- Define what we need in addition to make our approach more robust and complete
- Tools for working with vector data
- Tools for working with raster data
- Producing beautiful maps by combining these tools with native plotting functionality
- ...?

## Exercises during the main course

- t.b.d.

## Which dataset will be used?

- DWD rain gauge positions
- DWD rain gauge observations
- DWD radar observations

## Optional: Which contents/skills will you address that were not explicitely addressed before?

- t.b.d.


## Optional: Upon which contents/skills will you explicitely build?

- dataframes
- multi-dimensional arrays
- plotting, multi-panel plots
- working with datetime formats
- ...


## Optional: Ideas for tasks in the Coding-Lab

t.b.d.
