# Level 3: Der Dataframe - ein Werkzeug für Tabellen

## Python

- [Hier](python/README.md) findet Ihr die Python-Inhalte.

## R

- [Hier](R/Dataframes.html) findet Ihr die einführenden R-Inhalte.
- [Hier](R/Dataframes2.html) findet Ihr die weiterführenden R-Inhalte (Analyse dekadischer Temperaturanomalien).

## Learning targets

- Students will be able to create, read and export dataframes (tabular data)
- Students will know basic concepts how to handle data in dataframes (indexing, NA values, subsets, apply functions ...)
- Students will be able to generate and customize basics plots (different types)

## Structure and main contents

The lecture will be devided in two parts. 
First, some R basics and some general examples using a very simple dataframe. 
Second, based on meteorological data, some simple analyses (aggregation, rolling means etc.) will be performed and results will be plotted.

## Exercises during the main course

- Illustrate decadal temperature changes (similar to IPCC plot) for two different stations in Norway (Oslo, Tromso)
- Illustrate seasonal variations in these temperature changes

## Which dataset will be used?

Meteorological station data (T and P; Oslo, Tromso) to be downloaded [here](https://klimaservicesenter.no)

## Optional: Which contents/skills will you address that were not explicitely addressed before?

Lorem ipsum...


## Optional: Upon which contents/skills will you explicitely build?

Lorem ipsum...


## Optional: Ideas for tasks in the Coding-Lab

Generate Walter-Lieth diagram for one station.
- Recap: Data import, subsetting, data aggregation, NA values, xy-plot
- Extent: Plotting with two y-axes, plot customization
