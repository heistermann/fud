# Level 6: Die n√§chste Dimension

## Python

- [Hier](python/multidim-arrays.html) findet Ihr die Python-Inhalte.

## R

- [Hier](R/README.md) findet Ihr die R-Inhalte.

## Learning goals

- To be able to recognise and handle the different formats of multidimensinal data (arrays, bricks, stacks, and cubes)
- To learn that visualising multidimensional data aids formulating research questions

## Structure and main contents

- Tales of scalars, vectors, matrices, and tensors
- What are "short" and "long" formats of tabulated data?
- Get a handle on multiple dimensions: indexes, subsets, and conditionals
- Now navigate: running loops or loop surrogates in arrays
- Useful **R** libraries (ncdf4, stars, ...) 
- Useful Python libraries
- Behind the scenes: Google Earth API for data cubes

## Exercises during the main course

- BASIC: Extract time series from a raster brick, stack, or NetCDF
- BASIC: Conditional plots to understand multivariate data

- MODERATE: Track patterns of deforestation in both space and time
- MODERATE: Conditional plots as stepping stones to hierarchical or multilevel models

- ADVANCED: Animate a year of global temperature or rainfall dynamics

## Which dataset will be used?

- CRU TS global gridded temperature and precipitation data
- Global forest change inventory
